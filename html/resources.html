      <h1> My Web Resources</h1>

      <ol>
        <li><h5><a target="_blank" href="https://w3schools.com">W3Schools</a> </h5>
          <p>Run by Refsnes and established in 1998, W3schools is an online education resource for web development. 
            It offers learning resources for many front and back-end languages that full stack web developers use 
            ranging from HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, SQL, PHP, Bootstrap, Java and C#, to mention but a few. <br />
            The site offers a large database of reference pages that are easy to access with links to code examples 
            on how to use each of them which I find comes in handy for when I need to refresh my memory or acquire 
            new skills in web development. The site is updated regularly and has also introduced paid courses over 
            the years as well as the addition of video tutorials. Though the paid courses are a little on the high side, 
            W3schools offers a huge free resource for both beginner and advanced web developers.<br />  
            <b>Rating 4.5/5</b> – <i>Great free resources for learning, and references with coding examples. 
              Currently, paid learning is a little on the high side, though there enough free content to work with.</i> 
            <br />
          </p> 
        </li>
        <li><h5><a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a> </h5>
          <p>Stackoverflow is a community-based question and answer forum-style website. It is used by both budding 
            programmers as well as industry professionals. It makes use of the Internet to pool and share experience 
            and knowledge especially pertaining to specific problems that programmers or anyone in the IT industry 
            have faced and documented through the forum-style Q & A.  <br />
            Stackoverflow rests on the principle that if you have a problem or need to help troubleshooting technology,
             there is bound to be someone in the world who once faced or is facing the same issue and you are bound to 
             find a solution already documented or find people willing to help and try and answer your questions. 
             I have found the site very useful as a developer as it provides wealth of shared experience. 
             The site also has a voting system on solutions as a means of quality control on posts. However, there can 
             be the occasional situation where you might find some really bad solutions or poorly asked questions, and
              at other times some solutions might lead to rabbit holes. Despite this, Stackoverflow is a must have 
              resource for any level developer.<br />  
            <b>Rating 4/5</b> – <i>Great pool of global resource for finding solutions. The occasional bad solutions 
              might leave you with more questions than answers so you kind of really have to be as specific as you can 
              in your search.</i> 
            <br />
          </p> 
        </li>
        <li><h5><a target="_blank" href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> </h5>
          <p>Coursera is an online course provider created in 2012 by Stanford University computer science professors. 
            Both free and paid courses are offered on the site. While the cost might be on the high side, I have found 
            Coursera useful for attaining certifications, and can be used by an developer at any level. The site also 
            offers full bachelor’s and master’s degrees from accredited schools like Arizona State University and the 
            University of London. Courses vary in difficulty, and most can be completed at your own pace. <br />
            I find Coursera useful in building up your career skills as a web developer and getting to build up your 
            resume for future job opportunities or for just adding more to your current skillset as a programmer or 
            developer. The courses go through quality control, are highly detailed, and most have a way to test your 
            understanding through quizzes and exams. As with any type of learning worthwhile, the courses can be 
            demanding at times and quite expensive. <br />  
            <b>Rating 3.75/4 </b> – <i>Great resource for building skills and resume. 
              Courses can be expensive and time demanding.</i> 
            <br />

        <li><h5><a target="_blank" href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3 Validator</a> </h5>
          <p>This is as tool that checks markup code (XHTML, HTML) in a website to determine if the code is following 
            established formatting standards. The validator ensures your code does not have any mistakes or is not 
            using obsolete syntax that might make it prone to errors when its opened on different browsers or devices.<br />
            This tool is important for any web developer as it saves time in having to look at every line of code for 
            errors and automates the code check and debugging for you. It will notify you with line numbers where 
            exactly the While that validator may check the validity of your code, this does not mean your website 
            is good. <br />  
            <b>Rating 4.5/5 </b> – <i>Great free source for validating markup code for any developer</i> 
            <br />

        <li><h5><a target="_blank" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Azure Cloud Services</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon AWS</a> </h5>
          <p>Microsoft Azure Cloud Services and Amazon AWS are cloud-based services that offer free trial plans for 
            cloud servers at a cheap rate. There are other cloud-based services out there but I have personally found 
            the use of Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS a good learning experience for implementing cloud servers and 
            learning backend programming as its used in the industry today.<br />
            I have used both services for personal projects to showcase my portfolio or to just learn about backend coding.
            Both services have student rates that are cheaper and offer a free trial for a reasonable amount of time. 
            However, I would make sure I close accounts that are near their trial end to avoid getting charged. 
            The billing plan can also get very confusing for first timers, and setting up the servers might require some 
            prior knowledge though they are well documented -  so be warned.  <br />  
            <b>Rating – 4/5 </b> – <i>Free trials are a big plus. If you want more functions, you may have to pay more 
              and the billing plan can be hard to understand at times.</i> 
            <br />
